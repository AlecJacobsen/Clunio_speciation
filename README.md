# Code for "Larval Competition for Space can Induce Allochronic Divergence in the Marine Midge, Clunio marinus"

Maniscrupt_Figures.ipynb is the jupyter notebook containing all of the code to generate the figures (besides the model schematic). It can be run using jupyter notebooks, or the code can be copied into a python file to be run as a stand-alone script. This notebook also contains the class used for the ecology model simulations (i.e. without exual reproduction, recombinations, or a genetic basis). Individual runs used for figures 2 and 3 were generated by using class within the notebook to run the simulations. 

Ecology_model/ contains the code used to generate figures 3 and S1. This folder contains Python scripts and accomanying Bash scripts intended to call the Python scripts on a computing cluster using Slurm as a workload manager. The Bash scripts may have to be modified for use on other computing clusters. 
 - run_optimized_eco_model.py executes the simulations for the parameter sweep (figure 3).
 - paramSweep.sbatch runs run_optimized_eco_model.py 1000 times, launching no more than 25 jobs at a time (including itself). It outputs files labelled as `{output directory}/rep{replicate}.npy`. Output directory can be modified by changing the `out_dir` variable at the start of the script.
