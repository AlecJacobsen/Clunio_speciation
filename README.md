`Manuscript_Figures.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook containing all of the code to generate the figures. It can be run using jupyter notebooks, or the code can be copied into a python file to be run as a stand-alone script. This notebook also contains the class used for the ecology model simulations (i.e. without exual reproduction, recombinations, or a genetic basis). Individual runs used for figures 2 and 3 were generated by using this class within the notebook to run the simulations. 

`Ecology_model/` contains the code used to generate figures 3 and S1. This folder contains Python scripts and accomanying Bash scripts which call the Python scripts on a computing cluster using Slurm as a workload manager. The Bash scripts may have to be modified for use on other computing clusters. 
 - `run_optimized_eco_model.py` executes the simulations for the parameter sweep (figure 3).
 - `paramSweep.sbatch` runs `run_optimized_eco_model.py` 1000 times, launching no more than 25 jobs at a time (including itself). It outputs files labelled as `{output directory}/rep{replicate}.npy`. Output directory can be modified by changing the `out_dir` variable at the start of the script.
 - `make-pip.py` runs a modified simulation with only a single, pre-specified mutation event in order to calculate pairwise invasibility of two phenotypes. 
 - `getPIPs.sbatch` runs `make-pip.py` 1000 times for all phenotypes and for three parameter combinations of $C_w$ and $\sigma_{dispersal}$ to generate the data for supplemental figure 1. Output files are labelled `{output directory}/Cw{value}-sd{value}_rep{replicate}.npy`. Output directory can be specified by changing the `out_dir` parameter at the start of the script.

`Genetic_model` contains the code
